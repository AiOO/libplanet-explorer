Contributor guide

Note: This document at present is for only code contributors.
We should expand it so that it covers reporting bugs, filing issues,
and writing docs.

-----------------------

We have a [Discord server] to discuss Libplanet.  There are some channels
for purposes:

 -  *#libplanet-users*: Chat with game programmers who use Libplanet.
    Ask questions to *use* Libplanet for your games.
 -  *#libplanet-dev*: Chat with maintainers and contributors of Libplanet.
    Ask questions to *hack* Libplanet and to make a patch for it.
 -  *#libplanet-users-kr*: The same purpose to *#libplanet-users*,
    except you can speak Korean instead English here.

Prerequisites
-------------

*Libplanet.Explorer* requires [.NET Core] 2.2 or higher.  If you use macOS and
[Homebrew], you can install it by `brew cask install dotnet-sdk` command.

Although it is not necessary, you should install a proper IDE for .NET
(or an [OmniSharp] extension for your favorite editor â€” except it takes
hours to properly configure and integrate with your editor).
C# is not like JavaScript or Python; it is painful to code in C# without IDE.

Unless you already have your favorite setup, we recommend you to use
[Visual Studio Code].  It is free, open source, and made by Microsoft, which
made .NET as well.  So Visual Studio Code has a [first-party C# extension][2]
which works well together.

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/

Build
-----

The following command installs dependencies (required library packages) and
builds the project:

    dotnet build


Style convention
----------------

Please follow the existing coding convention.  We are already using several
static analyzers.  They are automatically executed together with `msbuild`,
and will warn you if there are any style errors.

You should also register Git hooks we commonly use:

    git config core.hooksPath hooks

We highly recommend you to install an extension for [EditorConfig] in your
favorite editor.  Some recent editors have built-in support for EditorConfig,
e.g., Rider (IntelliJ IDEA), Visual Studio.  Many editors have an extension to
support EditorConfig, e.g., [Atom], [Emacs], [Vim], [VS Code].

[Vim]: https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim
